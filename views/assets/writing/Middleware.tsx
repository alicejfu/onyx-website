          <h2>Methods and Middleware</h2>
          <div id='middleIntro'>
            <p>When you import the Onyx module, what you're really importing is an object called 'Onyx' that has a number of built-in methods. 
                A couple of those methods you will need to use as Oak middleware to use Onyx. 
                Others are primarily used by Onyx under the hood to assist with the authentication process. 
                However, if you are a developer interested in creating new or custom strategies for Onyx, it will likely be important to understand how these work.</p> 
            <p>First, though, let's go over Onyx's most vital methods: <code>onyx.use()</code> and <code>onyx.authenticate()</code></p>
          </div>
          <div id='use'>
            <h3>onyx.use</h3>
            <p><code>onyx.use()</code> configures and stores a strategy to to be implemented later on by Onyx. 
            This step <b>must be completed first</b> in order to continue authentication process.
            After all, without a strategy, Onyx doesn't have anything to use to complete the authentication process.</p>

          </div>
          <div id='authenticate'>
            <h3>onyx.authenticate</h3>
            <p><code>onyx.authenticate()</code> is the heart of Onyx â€” it's what you will use to initiate an authenticate process.</p>
            <p>When you want to authenticate a user, simply invoke <code>onyx.authenticate()</code> and pass in a reference to the strategy you stored with <code>onyx.use()</code> above.</p>
          </div>
          <div id='initialize'>
            <h3>onyx.initialize</h3>
            <p>As you might expect, <code>onyx.initialize()</code> creates a new instance of Onyx for each user and sets up its initial state.
            Though it's a simple line of code, it is vital for ensuring Onyx autehnticates each individual user properly.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Serialization and Deserialization</p>
          <div id='serialize'>
            <h3>onyx.serializeUser</h3>
            <p>Similar to <code>onyx.use()</code>, <code>onyx.serializeUser()</code> stores a callback  </p>
          </div>
          <div id='deserialize'>
            <h3>onyx.deserializeUser</h3>
            <p></p>
          </div>
          <p>While the following methods are not required to authenticate with Onyx, you may find them useful to understand if you are creating a custom strategy.</p>
          <div id='unuse'>
            <h3>onyx.unuse</h3>
            <p><code>onyx.unuse()</code> does exactly what it sounds like it does: It deletes the strategy you stored when using <code>onyx.use()</code>.</p>
          </div>
          <div id='init'>
            <h3>onyx.init</h3>
            <p><code>onyx.init()</code> is invoked every time a new instance of an Onyx object is created. 
            It creates an instance of the session manager, which controls and creates user sessions.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
